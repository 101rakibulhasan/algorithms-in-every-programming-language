*2. Write code that is the most efficient in every case.
3. The code can have an "Explanation section" why this code is efficient and working
4. The code can have Time Complexity and Space Complexity written in comment like-
	" Time Complexity  - O(n)
	  Space Complexity - O(1) " 
*5. The code must have an "I/O section" example in comment at the end like this-
	" Input: 
		abc

	  Output:

*6. If the alorithm has encryption and decryption process, put those in "Encryption" & "Decryption" folder separately
