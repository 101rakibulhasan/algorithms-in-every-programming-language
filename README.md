2. C++
3. JavaScript
4. MatLab
5. Python

# HOW TO SUPPORT?
Anyone can send Pull Request of their code if -
1. There is not code for that DSA in any other folder or programming language.
2. If the previous one is not efficient enough, your one is better.
3. Previous one has Issues, you have solution for it.

# What do we mean by Efficient?
The codes here must be efficient on Complexity, Understandability and support many testcases, error handling in any condition.
